# GKE-RBAC-WALKTHROUGH

While Cloud IAM is a good first level of security for GKE, Role-Based Access Control can offer a higher degree of granularity. Different teams might need different sort of access when managing an app on GKE. For instance, a team developers will require a different type of access to a team of testers. That type of finer control can be achieved through RBAC which will allow you to secure your namespaces as well as your clusters.
